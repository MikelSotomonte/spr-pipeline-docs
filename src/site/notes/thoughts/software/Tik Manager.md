[Tik Manager](https://tik-manager.com/) is an open source pipeline tool. I am helping to develop it in some areas, focusing on [[thoughts/software/Houdini\|Houdini]] and [[thoughts/USD\|USD]]. 

I have also made custom extractors for [[thoughts/software/Maya\|Maya]], custom to this pipeline and not part of Tik Manager, such as the character animation extractor
