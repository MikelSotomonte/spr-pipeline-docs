Allowed software: [[thoughts/Zbrush\|Zbrush]], [[thoughts/Blender\|Blender]], [[thoughts/Maya\|Maya]], [[thoughts/Houdini\|Houdini]].

Modeling will either be done in a [[thoughts/Tik Manager\|Tik Manager]]- "compatible" software like maya, or in one that isn't, like zbrush. If done in zbrush, it can be saved in \manual\ , or better, in a [[thoughts/Maya\|Maya]] or [[thoughts/Blender\|Blender]] file and then ingested into Tik. 

In this same department, uvs must be done, before moving to other departments ideally.
