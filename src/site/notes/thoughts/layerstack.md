This is the order of the layer stack as far as I can foresee.

The [[thoughts/asset\|asset]]s must be made first, and once those are done, we can start working on [[shot\|shot]]s.


# [[thoughts/asset\|asset]] layerstack

The [[thoughts/asset\|asset]] layerstack will look something like this for the most complex asset types, removing some of the layers when not necessary. 

All of the layers will be merged in the [[thoughts/assembly\|assembly]] department.
