This is the order of the layer stack as far as I can foresee.

The [[thoughts/asset\|asset]]s must be made first, and once those are done, we can start working on [[shot\|shot]]s.


# [[thoughts/asset\|asset]]s

All of the asset [[thoughts/departments/department\|department]]s will be combined in the [[thoughts/departments/assembly\|assembly]] layer, with the exception of the [[rig\|rig]] department because it's done in maya and needs to stay there to be taken into  [[animation\|animation]]
