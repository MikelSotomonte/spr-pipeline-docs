This is a casual way of jotting down all my thoughts and to-do's that I'd like to have in the [[thoughts/sprouts\|sprouts]] pipeline.


The pipeline will be based in [[thoughts/USD\|USD]]

The pipeline relies on [[thoughts/software/Tik Manager\|Tik Manager]] to do a lot of the heavy lifting.

The two main [[thoughts/software/software\|software]] will be [[thoughts/software/Maya\|Maya]] and [[thoughts/software/Houdini\|Houdini]]. 

There are two challenges, interoperavility between software, and between departments. Everything must be version controlled and all of that stuff.
