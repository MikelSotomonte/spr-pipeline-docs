# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is the "documentation" for the SproutsðŸ§ª pipeline, mantained by me (Mikel). This is also where I am writing down my thoughts from time to time, so expect two things:

 - [[website/Thoughts\|Thoughts]]: A connected jamble of thoughts and notes. I use this to try to keep track of everything design and architecture as the pipeline evolves.
 - [[Docs\|Docs]]: more organized documentation meant to actually be read and used by you. 
 
 On the right you can see a little graph of how the pages are connected. This is handy if you are trying to find information but can't quite remember the name of it, or if you're trying to see how things are connected. There is a slider to control how far this graph goes.
