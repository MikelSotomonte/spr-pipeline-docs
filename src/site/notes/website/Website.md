# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is the "documentation" for the SproutsðŸ§ª pipeline, mantained by me (Mikel). This is also where I am writing down my thoughts from time to time, so expect two things:

 - [[website/Thoughts\|Thoughts]]: A connected jamble of thoughts and notes. I use this to try to keep track of everything design and architecture as the pipeline evolves.
 - [[Docs\|Docs]]: more organized documentation meant to actually be read and used by you. Have a look around!
