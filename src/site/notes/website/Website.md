# Hello! 👋

This is the documentation for the Sprouts🧪 pipeline, mantained by me (Mikel). This is also where I am writing down my thoughts from time to time, so I've split it into two sections:

 - [[website/Thoughts\|Thoughts]]: A connected jamble of thoughts and notes. I use this to try to keep track of everything design and architecture as the pipeline evolves.
 - [[website/Docs\|Docs]]: more organized documentation meant to actually be read and used by you. 

---

On the right you can see a little graph of how the pages are connected. This is handy if you are trying to find information but can't quite remember the name of it, or if you're trying to see how things are connected. There is a slider (*looks like this:* ⚪) to control how far this graph goes. It's also just pretty neat.

There is also a pretty good search button🔍, I'm sure it will come in handy as this documentation grows.

Hover on an [[website/underlined link\|underlined link]] to preview it's contents. 

On the left, you can see all of the pages. This will be more handy if you're trying to navigate the [[website/Docs\|Docs]] rather than the [[website/Thoughts\|Thoughts]].

Lastly, you can click on the top, where it says "Sprouts Pipeline" to come back to this page.
