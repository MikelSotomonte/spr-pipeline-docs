Animation! This time, inside our pipeline. 

So, at this point we should have the layout for any given shot. This is where we will start.

Side note! Some shots might be in the testing section, please when moving to animation, move to the Main section, creating a sequence subproject when necessary.

The layout file might contain one or multiple shots, either way, save it to the animation tab. The things that have to be checked/done once we're in animation:

## Setup
Make sure the scene follows the correct structure;
Feel free to create the structure in this TIK menu ![Pasted image 20260201005139.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020260201005139.png)
Make sure to put:
- characters inside geometry/chr, 
- props (all animated objects with or without rig that isn't characters) in geometry/prp
- all environment stuff in geometry/set, I recommend putting the layout stuff in /geometry/set/layout, but not strictly necessary
- image planes (if they're gonna be used for rendering or comp) and mattepaints in /geometry/dmp (digital matte painting)
- all kind of temp or reference effect in /geometry/fx, or feel free to not include them
- the render camera must be named RENDER and be inside cameras/ . I am still tweaking this so if you have a rig for the camera, for example, cameras/controller/RENDER, please let me know, as I am trying to improve this after the POC

Anything not included in the structure won't be included in the export, feel free to use this to your advantage, adding animation reference image planes, temporary lights or whatever you wish.

Please offset the animation from layout as needed, so the start of the shot is 1001. This is a good time to set the shot's frame range. You can do so by right-clicking on the shot, clicking on edit task, and overriding the end_frame. If you don't have TIK permissions to do this, contact me. There are some people I gave these permissions to, I don't remember the people exactly.![Pasted image 20260201005625.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020260201005625.png)
Once we export animation to houdini, there will be two different works, the maya and the houdini ones. It is crucial that these two are not named the same way, so please follow this template: ![Pasted image 20260201005910.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020260201005910.png)

The rigs from layout could be outdated, it's a good time to replace the references with the current rigs before starting animation. 
## Other files
Some files, like video or audio reference, should be handled through the MANUAL2 folder, for example:
`PROJECT\MANUAL2\cg\03_shot\02_main\TreeArea\030\animation\reference_v001.mp4`

## Taking previews/playblasts
 TIK has this built-in way of taking previews, I think it has its advantages as it streamlines the process and is consistent between shots, but I think it also gave us some problems in early layout. I admit I haven't had the time to look into this further, so I would suggest trying this way and if it's more trouble than it's worth, to do playblasts the normal way. ![Pasted image 20260201010148.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020260201010148.png)
 ![Pasted image 20260201010328.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020260201010328.png)
 If done the TIK way, the previews will end up in this path: ![Pasted image 20260201010356.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020260201010356.png)
 inside the "previews" folder

## Exporting
There are three things that can be exported, and all of them are disabled by default. This way, we can export only what's necessary.
 ![Pasted image 20260201010533.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020260201010533.png)
 I recommend disabling the "Take Preview" option, this would just make a playblast.
#### Characters
If the rigs are following the pipeline (and they have an assembly version) you should see each character in that list, where you can remove them if you want. For simplicity's sake, I recommend reexporting all of the characters even if you only update one in a given shot, but there is the option in case a shot has multiple animators that work on separate characters, or any exception like that.
For exporting props, that will just export everything under the geometry/prp group, which is less strict but also more loose pipelinewise. For work in progresses, if you have a character that is still not properly appearing in the character section, you can put them in props and they will get exported. Please let me know if this is the case, as this will not work on other departments and should be addressed as soon as possible.

Make sure that __Start Frame__ and __End Frame__ are correct, and we probably never want to enable Static Single Frame for animation.

#### Camera
Same settings explained in characters

#### Environment
Here Static Single Sample is enabled by default, which means only one frame will be exported. If you have an environment that has some sort of animation, you can disable this, but it's on by default to avoid saving huge files when it's not necessary. I also usually set the End Frame to 1001, just in case the Static Single Sample is glitched or something. But it should be fine hahah

## Up next
I want to polish a couple of things on the houdini side, and make a nice template for everyone to follow when importing animations there, so I will not document that just yet. Please let me know if you have any questions or I missed anything, I'm happy to help. Have fun animating!
