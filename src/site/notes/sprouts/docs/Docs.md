Welp, I haven't done a lot of actual documentation yet... Leila did [this lovely guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DJBiOXlibJ0Oaoi5wXTbmZM5Ps4Lsh33EJfQPW5Bk0M/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.aioiluicr5of) last project week! I helped a little bit. She called it the "**Tik Manager Handbook**". 

That's it for now.
