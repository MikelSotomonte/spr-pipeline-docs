# Opening Houdini with the SPROUT configuration
Because of pipeline reasons, if you open Houdini normally, there will be missing configurations and tools. That's why you need to launch it this way:
1. Open TIK Manager
2. Open Houdini from the "Standalone" menu.

3. Wait until Houdini is open. 

### How to know it worked:
This is not necessary, but a quick way to know if Houdini opened correctly, is to just try to create a TIK Lop import node. Make sure you're in the stage context.

The SPROUT Houdini did not launch properly.

Good! Everything should work

# Opening a file
To load a file, go to the TIK shelf (if you don't see it, press the little + in the shelf tabs, and find it there) and open TIK from inside Houdini.

Once open, navigate to the WORK you want to load, make sure the version is the latest (or the one you want to load), and click Load.

### WORK vs PUBLISH
WORK refers to work files, usually operated on by the same person - basically different versions of the same working file. So just the character_v001.ma, character_v002.ma and so on.

Publish refers to the versions that are useful to other departments, or that could be final. When making a publish, depending on the department, multiple things will be saved. For example, in Modeling, the maya file and a usd export of the model will get saved. In animation, it will save the maya file, export the animation to usd, and do a playblast of the animation. 
you can find the different Elements that a publish generates here:

# Importing assets to Houdini.
To import assets into Houdini, use the TIK Lop import node, in solaris (stage). From there, feel free to add a null and sop import it into the obj context.
I recommend using any of these two ðŸ¥•icon recipes when creating it, so that the project field will be filled-in when creating the node.
![Pasted image 20250917183848.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250917183848.png)

The Project field must be set to "$SPR/SPR". 
Click Set Sub-project to chose the correct path, and then choose what you want with the different dropdowns.

Depending on the publish, there are some cases where you might need to check the "Allow All Elements" to see the element you want to import in the "Element" field. Try without first, and then see if it's necessary.

# Saving a Houdini file
There are different ways to save a file. We can make a new version, we can save on the current file, or we can make a publish, which also saves the file as well as exporting the published things.

### 1. Saving a new version
To save  a new version, simply click the "New Version" button in the shelf. Add the notes (optional, but please do) and click Create New Version.
![Pasted image 20250917174259.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250917174259.png)

### 2. Saving to the current file
This functions the same way as saving normally. But because some people use different licenses of Houdini (Houdini FX, Houdini Education, Houdini Indie...), please:
> [!danger]
> DO NOT SAVE USING CTRL+S OR FROM THE FILE MENU!

This could change the extension, (from .hip to .hiplc for example) and Tik would lose track of the file itself. This would mean that it would be saved, but we wouldn't see it in TIK. If this happens, let Mikel know asap to fix it.

Instead, use this convenient button from the SPROUT shelf called "Save"

### 3. Making a Publish.
As explained above, this should mainly be done when you want to export to another program, or to another department. For now, if you're going to make a PUBLISH from Houdini, please ask Mikel for guidance before doing it.

# The SPROUT Shelf Tools
![Pasted image 20250917195115.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250917195115.png)
There are some tools I can not live without, and some that I have specifically developed for the SPROUT pipeline. You can find them in the SPROUT Shelf Tools. This is what the important ones do.

1. Auto Update Toggle - Hotkey: F11 - Toggles between Auto Update and Manual update (same as the bottom right button in the Houdini interface). Useful to change nodes around and things like that in heavy scenes, to avoid the node graph updating every time you do something.
2. Object Merge Shortcut - Hotkey: Ctrl+Shift+V - Copy a node from any context - obj, stage, etc. Paste with the custom hotkey and you will get an object merge, lop import, sop import, fetch, whatever. Probably my favorite tool here.
3. Find and Replace - Find some text and replace it with another. Can be applied to selected nodes, or to all of the nodes in the .hip file. Useful for changing paths of files in bulk, for example
4. Replace ENV VAR - Find if text (usually a path) could be replaced by an environment variable. For example, the root directory of our project is set to the "SPR" env variable, this is useful to convert paths from /MANUAL for example, to the relative path notation, which should always be used to ensure everything works from any computer (at uni, from home, etc)
5. Convert Path to HEAVY - HEAVY is the directory for heavy files, such as caches. This tool will create folders in the HEAVY path mirroring what was set.
![Pasted image 20250919110553.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250919110553.png)
Simply write HEAVY in the field you want to convert, and click the tool.
![Pasted image 20250919110620.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250919110620.png)
The path gets converted to the heavy folder root, mirroring the rest of the path.
6. Save - Explained above, save the .hip file without changing the extension even if using from a different Houdini license version.
