# A New Naming System

As of 27/10/2025, the shot naming has changed, as suggested by Marcos. From now on, the shots will be named the following way:

> [!NOTE] EnvironmentName_010

 The name will start by the name of the environment the shot happens in, starting from 010, then 020, then 030. This means, there will be `EnvironmentOne_010`, and `EnvironmentTwo_010`, the numbering "restarts" for every environment.

This allows for easier modeling of environments, master lightings, and anything that is shared in the same "sequence".

In other words, our sequences became environment names! I will call them sequences from now on, to distinguish between sequence and environment modeling.

Each sequence will contain every shot from it, as well as a "master" shot, where we can work on multi-shot stuff, such as master lighting, or previs.

For example:

```
Main
|- FieldA
|  |- Master
|  |- 010
|  |- 020
|
|- OtoBooth
|  |- Master
|  |- 010
|  |- 020
...
```

The environment assets will be modeled inside the Master for each sequence, instead of in /asset/env. It's cleaner this way, I think.

Annoyingly, we're going to have to migrate the previs shots to this new system. Sorry, I wish we had known a week earlier, but it is ultimately for the greater good.

The new sequences can be found under the "Main" section, because I am expecting us to carry the whole production in here, instead of just the layout stage. Layout will become obsolete but I'm keeping it untouched to avoid breaking references in maya files, things like that.


# New Layout Work
In the Last Layout meeting, there were some suggestions of merging some shots to make them more dramatic, so before working on Layout, please talk to Igor and/or Mikel just to check. We still have to decide what feedback we're going with as of when I'm writing this.

As mentioned above, previs work should be done entirely in the Master Tasks, not on the shot themselves. For consistency, let's do this even if some sequences only contain one shot, always do the previs in Master. 

Because of this new workflow, the previs for every shot in a sequence must be done by the same person. It might be a bit more work, but other people will be able to focus on other tasks, and we will get a more consistent and coherent result at the end.

# Pipeline, new Maya tools
Documenting this soon! I don't have maya installed on my computer rn
