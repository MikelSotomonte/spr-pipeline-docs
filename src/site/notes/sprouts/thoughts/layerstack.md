#usd
This is the order of the layer stack as far as I can foresee.

The [[sprouts/thoughts/asset\|asset]]s must be made first, and once those are done, we can start working on [[sprouts/thoughts/shot\|shot]]s.


# [[sprouts/thoughts/asset\|asset]]s

All of the asset [[sprouts/thoughts/department\|department]]s will be combined in the [[sprouts/thoughts/assembly\|assembly]] layer, with the exception of the [[sprouts/thoughts/rig\|rig]] department because it's done in maya and needs to stay there to be taken into  [[animation\|animation]]. That's why there is not a layerstack by perse, because we will just combine everything into the assembly [[sprouts/thoughts/layer\|layer]]
