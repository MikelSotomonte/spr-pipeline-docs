This is the order of the layer stack as far as I can foresee.

The [[sprouts/thoughts/asset\|asset]]s must be made first, and once those are done, we can start working on [[sprouts/thoughts/shot\|shot]]s.


# [[sprouts/thoughts/asset\|asset]]s

All of the asset [[sprouts/thoughts/departments/department\|department]]s will be combined in the [[sprouts/thoughts/departments/assembly\|assembly]] layer, with the exception of the [[sprouts/thoughts/departments/rig\|rig]] department because it's done in maya and needs to stay there to be taken into  [[animation\|animation]]
