#pipeline/departments/asset

Modeling will either be done in a [[sprouts/thoughts/Tik Manager\|Tik Manager]]- "compatible" software like maya, or in one that isn't, like [[sprouts/thoughts/Zbrush\|Zbrush]] or [[sprouts/thoughts/Marvelous\|Marvelous]]. If done in zbrush, it can be saved in \manual\ , or better, in a [[sprouts/thoughts/Maya\|Maya]] or [[sprouts/thoughts/Blender\|Blender]] file and then ingested into Tik. 

In this same department, uvs must be done, before moving to other departments ideally.
