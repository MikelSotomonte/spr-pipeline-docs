#pipeline/software

Djv is an exr sequence viewer. It allows OCIO transforms and has a lot of great features. More light weight than [[sprouts/thoughts/software/Open RV\|Open RV]], which might be a bit overkill for us. Only feature I am missing from that is the syncsketch-like drawing for feedback.
