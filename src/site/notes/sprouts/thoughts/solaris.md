#usd 

Solaris is [[sprouts/thoughts/Houdini\|Houdini]]'s [[sprouts/thoughts/USD\|USD]] work environment. Lighting, Rendering, Combining USD Layers, etc. will be done here. 

This is THE video to watch if you want to learn how to use USD in Solaris. It's a little bit advanced, but it covers a lot of ground and is really well structured.  [LOPs for Solo Artists](https://youtu.be/WfC16LYYIAw?si=ploDRBvjzZE26z33)
