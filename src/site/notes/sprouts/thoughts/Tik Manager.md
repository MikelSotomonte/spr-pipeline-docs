#pipeline/software 
[Tik Manager](https://tik-manager.com/) is an open source pipeline tool. I am helping to develop it in some areas, focusing on [[sprouts/thoughts/Houdini\|Houdini]] and [[sprouts/thoughts/USD\|USD]]. 

I have also made custom extractors for [[sprouts/thoughts/Maya\|Maya]], custom to this pipeline and not part of Tik Manager, such as the character animation extractor
