#pipeline/departments/asset 

For simplicity, Lookdev will be done inside the [[sprouts/thoughts/assembly\|assembly]] department/layer. This way we can see all of the different [[sprouts/thoughts/components\|components]] in the same scene and there won't be a chicken-and-egg problem of needing the assets together to do the lookdev, but needing the lookdev as part of the assembly.
