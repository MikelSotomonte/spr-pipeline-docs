# Hello! 👋

This is the documentation for the Sprouts🧪 pipeline and project, maintained by me (Mikel). This is also where I am writing down my thoughts from time to time, so I've split it into two sections:

 - [[sprouts/website/Thoughts\|Thoughts]]: A connected jumble of thoughts and notes. Fun to look around if you're curious, but I won't be maintaining this on the long-run, it's just nice to have some random notes here.
 - [[sprouts/docs/Docs\|Docs]]: More organized documentation meant to actually be read and used by you. 

---

On the right you can see a little graph of how the pages are connected. This is handy if you are trying to find information but can't quite remember the name of it, or if you're trying to see how things are connected. There is a slider (*looks like this:* ⚪) to control how far this graph goes. It's also just pretty neat.

There is also a pretty good search button🔍, I'm sure it will come in handy as this documentation grows.

Hover on an [[sprouts/website/underlined link\|underlined link]] to preview it's contents. 

On the left, you can see all of the pages. This will be more handy if you're trying to navigate the [[sprouts/docs/Docs\|Docs]] rather than the [[sprouts/website/Thoughts\|Thoughts]].
